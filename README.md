This project is about communication efficieny of ant colonies. We are investigating local and global efficiencies of 2 ant colonies in 2 different ways. Firstly we will be looking at the efficiency of 2 colonies in the same observation day and compare it with 100 simulated similar colonies to see the communication change between ants and colonies. Secondly we will be looking at the communication change on colonies through out the 41 days of observation and how died ants effects communication inside the colony.
